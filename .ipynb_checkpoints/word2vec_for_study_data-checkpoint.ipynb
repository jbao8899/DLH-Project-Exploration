Bilateral lower lobe predominant peribronchovascular opacity with more confluent consolidation in the LLL , suggestive of bronchopneumonia Hilar and mediastinal adenopathy is likely reactive Aberrant right subclavian artery EKG sinus tachycardia at 116 , no ST elevations depressions Brief Hospital Course Middle aged Male with history of MR , brittle DM I who presented with hypoglycemia , multifocal PNA initially admitted to the ICU for resp distress but transferred to the floor without need for intubation Multifocal PNA Pt noted on CXR and Chest CT to have multifocal PNA He was initially admitted to the ICU given the concern for possible intubation 1 16 tachypnea however his breathing rate has subsequently improved He was transferred from the ICU to the floor on IV Vancomycin , Cefepime and Azithromycin Microbiology work up has consisted of blood cultures , MRSA screen Urine legionella was also negative He was transitioned to oral antibiotics of Azithromycin however he was noted to develop a drug rash It is unclear if it was due to the Azithromycin versus Zofran , though I suspect it may be Azithromycin given his history of abx allergies He was transitioned to Doxycycline Hyclate 100mg twice a day Thrombocytopenia Pt was noted to have some thrombocytopenia during his hospitalization but did not require any platelet transfusions On review of OMR it appears he has a history of thrombocytopenia down to the 60s 100s between 2119 2126 His platelet count was trended and noted to improve , transient plt drop may have been due to Vancomycin , can continue outpatient follow up Hypoglycemia Pt noted to be hypoglycemic prior to admission , though subsequent CBGs showed no hypoglycemia The hypoglycemia was likely due to poor PO intake given his infectious state Last Name ( un ) was consulted and followed the patient in house , he was discharged on Lantus 20units and Metformin 500mg Mental Retardation Agitation He was continued on his
